# OpenSyria Mainnet Seed Nodes
#
# This file is intentionally empty for the initial launch.
# OpenSyria is a new blockchain and does not yet have established seed nodes.
#
# IMPORTANT: Before mainnet launch, this file should be populated with
# IP addresses of reliable OpenSyria mainnet nodes.
#
# Format: <ip>:<port> # <optional AS number comment>
# Example: 192.0.2.1:9633 # AS12345
#
# To generate this file after deploying seed nodes:
#   1. Deploy 10+ geographically distributed OpenSyria nodes
#   2. Run: python3 contrib/seeds/makeseeds.py < nodes_main_raw.txt > nodes_main.txt
#   3. Run: python3 contrib/seeds/generate-seeds.py . > ../src/chainparamsseeds.h
#
# For initial network bootstrap without seeds, use:
#   opensyriad -addnode=<known_node_ip>:9633
#
# TODO [CRITICAL - PRE-LAUNCH]: Populate with actual OpenSyria node addresses
