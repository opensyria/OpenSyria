*version* Release Notes Draft
===============================

OpenSY version *version* is now available from:

  <https://opensy.net/bin/opensy-core-*version*/>

This release includes new features, various bug fixes and performance
improvements, as well as updated translations.

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/OpenSY-Qt` (on macOS)
or `opensyd`/`opensy-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of OpenSY that has reached its EOL is
possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of OpenSY are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

OpenSY is supported and tested on the following operating systems or newer:
Linux Kernel 3.17, macOS 14, and Windows 10 (version 1903). OpenSY
Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as
frequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use OpenSY on
unsupported systems.
