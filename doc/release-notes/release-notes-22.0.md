22.0 Release Notes
==================

OpenSY version 22.0 is now available from:

  <https://opensy.net/bin/opensy-core-22.0/>

This release includes new features, various bug fixes and performance
improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/OpenSY-Qt` (on Mac)
or `opensyd`/`opensy-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of OpenSY that has reached its EOL is
possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of OpenSY are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

OpenSY is supported and extensively tested on operating systems
using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.14+, and Windows 7 and newer.  OpenSY
Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as
frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use OpenSY on
unsupported systems.

From OpenSY 22.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.14 are no longer supported.

Notable changes
===============

P2P and network changes
-----------------------
- Added support for running OpenSY as an
  [I2P (Invisible Internet Project)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P) service
  and connect to such services. See [i2p.md](https://github.com/opensy/opensy/blob/22.x/doc/i2p.md) for details. (#20685)
- This release removes support for Tor version 2 hidden services in favor of Tor
  v3 only, as the Tor network [dropped support for Tor
  v2](https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline) with the release of
  Tor version 0.4.6.  Henceforth, OpenSY ignores Tor v2 addresses; it
  neither rumors them over the network to other peers, nor stores them in memory
  or to `peers.dat`.  (#22050)

- Added NAT-PMP port mapping support via
  [`libnatpmp`](https://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/libnatpmp.html). (#18077)

New and Updated RPCs
--------------------

- Due to [BIP 350](https://github.com/opensy/bips/blob/master/bip-0350.mediawiki)
  being implemented, behavior for all RPCs that accept addresses is changed when
  a native witness version 1 (or higher) is passed. These now require a Bech32m
  encoding instead of a Bech32 one, and Bech32m encoding will be used for such
  addresses in RPC output as well. No version 1 addresses should be created
  for mainnet until consensus rules are adopted that give them meaning
  (as will happen through [BIP 341](https://github.com/opensy/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki)).
  Once that happens, Bech32m is expected to be used for them, so this shouldn't
  affect any production systems, but may be observed on other networks where such
  addresses already have meaning (like signet). (#20861)

- The `getpeerinfo` RPC returns two new boolean fields, `bip152_hb_to` and
  `bip152_hb_from`, that respectively indicate whether we selected a peer to be
  in compact blocks high-bandwidth mode or whether a peer selected us as a
  compact blocks high-bandwidth peer. High-bandwidth peers send new block
  announcements via a `cmpctblock` message rather than the usual inv/headers
  announcements. See BIP 152 for more details. (#19776)

- `getpeerinfo` no longer returns the following fields: `addnode`, `banscore`,
  and `whitelisted`, which were previously deprecated in 0.21. Instead of
  `addnode`, the `connection_type` field returns manual. Instead of
  `whitelisted`, the `permissions` field indicates if the peer has special
  privileges. The `banscore` field has simply been removed. (#20755)

- The following RPCs:  `gettxout`, `getrawtransaction`, `decoderawtransaction`,
  `decodescript`, `gettransaction`, and REST endpoints: `/rest/tx`,
  `/rest/getutxos`, `/rest/block` deprecated the following fields (which are no
  longer returned in the responses by default): `addresses`, `reqSigs`.
  The `-deprecatedrpc=addresses` flag must be passed for these fields to be
  included in the RPC response. This flag/option will be available only for this major release, after which
  the deprecation will be removed entirely. Note that these fields are attributes of
  the `scriptPubKey` object returned in the RPC response. However, in the response
  of `decodescript` these fields are top-level attributes, and included again as attributes
  of the `scriptPubKey` object. (#20286)

- When creating a hex-encoded opensy transaction using the `opensy-tx` utility
  with the `-json` option set, the following fields: `addresses`, `reqSigs` are no longer
  returned in the tx output of the response. (#20286)

- The `listbanned` RPC now returns two new numeric fields: `ban_duration` and `time_remaining`.
  Respectively, these new fields indicate the duration of a ban and the time remaining until a ban expires,
  both in seconds. Additionally, the `ban_created` field is repositioned to come before `banned_until`. (#21602)

- The `setban` RPC can ban onion addresses again. This fixes a regression introduced in version 0.21.0. (#20852)

- The `getnodeaddresses` RPC now returns a "network" field indicating the
  network type (ipv4, ipv6, onion, or i2p) for each address.  (#21594)

- `getnodeaddresses` now also accepts a "network" argument (ipv4, ipv6, onion,
  or i2p) to return only addresses of the specified network.  (#21843)

- The `testmempoolaccept` RPC now accepts multiple transactions (still experimental at the moment,
  API may be unstable). This is intended for testing transaction packages with dependency
  relationships; it is not recommended for batch-validating independent transactions. In addition to
  mempool policy, package policies apply: the list cannot contain more than 25 transactions or have a
  total size exceeding 101K virtual bytes, and cannot conflict with (spend the same inputs as) each other or
  the mempool, even if it would be a valid BIP125 replace-by-fee. There are some known limitations to
  the accuracy of the test accept: it's possible for `testmempoolaccept` to return "allowed"=True for a
  group of transactions, but "too-long-mempool-chain" if they are actually submitted. (#20833)

- `addmultisigaddress` and `createmultisig` now support up to 20 keys for
  Segwit addresses. (#20867)

Changes to Wallet or GUI related RPCs can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.

Build System
------------

- Release binaries are now produced using the new `guix`-based build system.
  The [/doc/release-process.md](/doc/release-process.md) document has been updated accordingly.

Files
-----

- The list of banned hosts and networks (via `setban` RPC) is now saved on disk
  in JSON format in `banlist.json` instead of `banlist.dat`. `banlist.dat` is
  only read on startup if `banlist.json` is not present. Changes are only written to the new
  `banlist.json`. A future version of OpenSY may completely ignore
  `banlist.dat`. (#20966)

New settings
------------

- The `-natpmp` option has been added to use NAT-PMP to map the listening port.
  If both UPnP and NAT-PMP are enabled, a successful allocation from UPnP
  prevails over one from NAT-PMP. (#18077)

Updated settings
----------------

Changes to Wallet or GUI related settings can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.

- Passing an invalid `-rpcauth` argument now cause opensyd to fail to start.  (#20461)

Tools and Utilities
-------------------

- A new CLI `-addrinfo` command returns the number of addresses known to the
  node per network type (including Tor v2 versus v3) and total. This can be
  useful to see if the node knows enough addresses in a network to use options
  like `-onlynet=<network>` or to upgrade to this release of OpenSY 22.0
  that supports Tor v3 only.  (#21595)

- A new `-rpcwaittimeout` argument to `opensy-cli` sets the timeout
  in seconds to use with `-rpcwait`. If the timeout expires,
  `opensy-cli` will report a failure. (#21056)

Wallet
------

- External signers such as hardware wallets can now be used through the new RPC methods `enumeratesigners` and `displayaddress`. Support is also added to the `send` RPC call. This feature is experimental. See [external-signer.md](https://github.com/opensy/opensy/blob/22.x/doc/external-signer.md) for details. (#16546)

- A new `listdescriptors` RPC is available to inspect the contents of descriptor-enabled wallets.
  The RPC returns public versions of all imported descriptors, including their timestamp and flags.
  For ranged descriptors, it also returns the range boundaries and the next index to generate addresses from. (#20226)

- The `bumpfee` RPC is not available with wallets that have private keys
  disabled. `psbtbumpfee` can be used instead. (#20891)

- The `fundrawtransaction`, `send` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt` RPCs now support an `include_unsafe` option
  that when `true` allows using unsafe inputs to fund the transaction.
  Note that the resulting transaction may become invalid if one of the unsafe inputs disappears.
  If that happens, the transaction must be funded with different inputs and republished. (#21359)

- We now support up to 20 keys in `multi()` and `sortedmulti()` descriptors
  under `wsh()`. (#20867)

- Taproot descriptors can be imported into the wallet only after activation has occurred on the network (e.g. mainnet, testnet, signet) in use. See [descriptors.md](https://github.com/opensy/opensy/blob/22.x/doc/descriptors.md) for supported descriptors.

GUI changes
-----------

- External signers such as hardware wallets can now be used. These require an external tool such as [HWI](https://github.com/opensy-core/HWI) to be installed and configured under Options -> Wallet. When creating a new wallet a new option "External signer" will appear in the dialog. If the device is detected, its name is suggested as the wallet name. The watch-only keys are then automatically imported. Receive addresses can be verified on the device. The send dialog will automatically use the connected device. This feature is experimental and the UI may freeze for a few seconds when performing these actions.

Low-level changes
=================

RPC
---

- The RPC server can process a limited number of simultaneous RPC requests.
  Previously, if this limit was exceeded, the RPC server would respond with
  [status code 500 (`HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#5xx_server_errors).
  Now it returns status code 503 (`HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`). (#18335)

- Error codes have been updated to be more accurate for the following error cases (#18466):
  - `signmessage` now returns RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY (-5) if the
    passed address is invalid. Previously returned RPC_TYPE_ERROR (-3).
  - `verifymessage` now returns RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY (-5) if the
    passed address is invalid. Previously returned RPC_TYPE_ERROR (-3).
  - `verifymessage` now returns RPC_TYPE_ERROR (-3) if the passed signature
    is malformed. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY (-5).
